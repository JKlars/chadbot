# Chad Bot

This is a multi functionality bot written in Eris that I made for fun.


## Installation

1) Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
2) Install Eris in the directory: ```npm i eris
        ```
3) Install ytdl-core in the directory: ```npm i ytdl-core
        ```
4) Install YTSWAK in the directory: ```npm i npm install youtube-search-without-api-key
        ```
5) Go to [discord dev portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create an application + a bot to recieve your token. Use this token in place of my config.token

6) You can either create your own config file in the directory or just replace config.prefix with one of your choosing
