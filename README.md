# Chad Bot

This is a multi functionality bot written in Eris that I made for fun.


## Installation

1) Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

2) Install axios in the directory: ```npm i axios
        ```
3) Go to [discord dev portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create an application + a bot to recieve your token. Use this token in place of my config.token

4) You can get your own google api key and create your own search engine from the Google API Console.

5) You can either create your own config file in the directory or just replace config.prefix with one of your choosing
